<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p><abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> Molly Smith had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <acronym title="nature">NNS</acronym> and all the other <dd>scientific</dd> journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's <s>favourite</s> book since college, and the longer she spent in these <i>four walls</i> the more she felt she needed to be <strong>free</strong>.</p>
    <p>She had spent the last <b>ten</b>years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama DNA, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em>think she had something better to do.</p>
